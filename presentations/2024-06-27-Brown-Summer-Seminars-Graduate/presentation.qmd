## Co-movement over the Business Cycle

Empirically, we observe co-movement across macro variables over the business cycle.

. . .

**Key Question in Macroeconomics:** What drives this co-movement?

- A single shock
- A common propagation mechanism

. . .

We show that...

- the "price of risk" is a common propagation mechanism that can be used to discern between models of the business cycle.

## What is the Price of Risk?

- A measure of the amount of compensation required to hold an additional unit of risk (volatility).

. . .

The SDF (stochastic discount factor) can be decomposed...

$$
\begin{align}
\text{SDF}_{t+1} = \mathbb{E}_t[\text{SDF}_{t+1}] + \text{Vol}_t[{\text{SDF}_{t+1}}] \epsilon_{t+1}
\end{align}
$$

- $\mathbb{E}_t[\text{SDF}_{t+1}]$ is the expected mean,
- $\text{Vol}_t[{\text{SDF}_{t+1}}]$ is the expected volatility (the price of risk),
- $\epsilon_{t+1}$ is an unforseen innovation (structural shocks).


## Estimating the Price of Risk

In most macro models, the Euler equation links the SDF to marginal utility:

$$
\text{SDF}_{t+1} = \beta \left(\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t}\right)^{-\gamma}
$$

. . .

Leveraging this, we can estimate the price of risk using changes in the volatility of consumption growth (or a similar measure).

## VFCI is an Estimate of the Market Price of Risk

Volatility Financial Conditions Index (VFCI) is **a** measure of the price of risk.

. . .

- Introduced in Adrian, Duarte, and Iyer (WP)

. . .

The VFCI is estimated as the predictable 

- changes in the volatility of GDP growth,
- using financial returns.

## VFCI

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_rect(
    data = rec_dates[start %between% as.Date(c("1965-01-01", "2017-01-01"))],
    aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = +Inf),
    fill = recession_color
  ) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = bg_line_color) + 
  geom_line(data = vfci_data, aes(x = date, y = scale(vfci))) +  
  scale_x_date(
    breaks = seq(as.Date("1960-01-01"), as.Date("2020-01-01"), by = "10 years"),
    labels = seq(1960, 2020, 10),
    limits = as.Date(c("1960-01-01", "2021-01-01")),
    expand = c(0,0)
  ) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Coditional Volatility (VFCI)",
    title = "Volatility Financial Conditions Index (VFCI)"
  ) +
  theme_pres
```

##  Mean - Vol Relationship

A key empirical result is that the price of risk (measured by the VFCI), is linearly linked to the conditional mean.



```{r}
#| fig-align: center
vfci_data |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = vfci,
    y = mu
  )) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_pres + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  labs(
    y = "Conditional Mean",
    x = "Condtional Volatility\n(VFCI)",
    title = "Conditionally Linear Mean - Vol"
  )
```

. . .

We will leverage this relationship to identify the business cycle in our VAR.



## VAR Setup

A strucutral VAR with $p$ lags and $k$ variables in vector $y_t$,
$$
B_0 y_t = B_1 y_{t-1} + . . . + B_p y_{t-p} + w_t
$$

the shocks $w_t$ are assumed to be orthogonal and to have unit variance.

. . .

Empirically, only the following $A_i$ matrices and reduced form residuals, $u_t$, are observed,

$$
 y_t = \underbrace{B_0^{-1}B_1}_{A_1} y_{t-1} + \dots + \underbrace{B_0^{-1}B_p}_{A_p} y_{t-p} + \underbrace{B_0^{-1}w_t}_{u_t}
$$





## Identification Problem

Need to identify a column of the impact matrix $B_0^{-1}$ to back out a structural shock:

$$
u_t = B_0^{-1} w_t
$$

. . .

We will start by using the VFCI as an instrument,

$$
\begin{align}
(1)\ \ \ \ \ \mathbf{E}[\text{VFCI}_t w_{1,t}^\prime] &= \alpha \neq 0
\\
(2)\ \ \ \mathbf{E}[\text{VFCI}_t w_{2:k,t}^\prime] &=  0
\end{align}
$$

Where (1) is a relavence condition and (2) is an exogeneity condition.

    fill = recession_color
  ) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = bg_line_color) +

    data = hd_data,
    aes(
      x = date,
      y = hd
    )

    x = NULL,
    y = "Contributions to Unemployment",
    title = "Historical Contributions to Unemployment Rate from Identifed VAR Shock",
    caption = "NBER recession dates shaded.\n VAR shock identified using the VFCI as an external instrument."
  ) +

    labels = seq(1960, 2020, 10),
    limits = as.Date(c("1960-01-01", "2021-01-01")),
    expand = c(0,0)
  ) +
  theme_pres
```


## Mean-Vol Relationship in the VAR

Taking our VAR with $p$ lags and $k$ variables in vector $y_t$,

$$
y_t = A_1 y_{t-1} + \text{ ... } + A_p y_{t-p} + u_t
$$

The log variance of the residual is then, $\sigma_t = \log\left(\widehat{u}_t^2\right)$.

Then estimate,

$$
\sigma_t = \alpha y_{t} + \varepsilon_t
$$

The mean-vol relationship is between $\widehat{y}_t$ and $\widehat{\sigma}_t$.

:::{.callout-note}
There are $k$ mean-vol relationships in the VAR, one for each variable.

## Mean-Vol Relationship in the VAR {#mean-vol-unemployment}

Using unemployment, we can see a strong linear relationship between the conditional mean and the conditional volatility.

## Matches the "Business Cycle Anatomy" Shock

Angeletos et al. (2020) identify a "Main Business Cycle (MBC) Shock" which drives most of the unforecasted variation in unemployment.

. . .

Our internal VAR shock has a correlation with the MBC shock of $0.75$.

## A New Business Cycle Fact

We show a new key feature of business cycles:

- the price of risk comoves with the mean of macro varaibles during the cycle.

. . .

This is not a feature in Real Business Cycle (RBC) or New Keynesian models.

. . .

You need a model that links second moments (volatilities) to first moments.


## Financial Conditions Propagate the Business Cycle

There exists a general equilibrium structural model that is consistent with

- the existence of the mean-vol relationship in the empirical data,

- and that the price of risk comoves with the business cycle.

. . .

This model has financial conditions aggregate, amplify, and propagate disparate shocks to the rest of the economy.

- Driven by a financial friction: the value-at-risk constraint.

## Conclusion

- Can use the VFCI or an internal VAR implied price of risk to identify a shock.
    - Looks like a business cycle.
    - Matches the "Main Business Cycle" shock.

- Adds a new empirical fact for distinguishing models of the business cycle.

- Consistent with a structural model where financial frictions create a common propagation mechanism through the price of risk.
