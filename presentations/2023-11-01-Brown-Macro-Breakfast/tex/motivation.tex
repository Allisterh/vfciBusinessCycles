  \vspace{0.25cm}

  ``Business Cycle Anatomy'' (2020) empirically identified a \textit{single} business cycle shock that moved
  \begin{itemize}
    \item unemployment, output, investment, hours worked, and consumption,
  \end{itemize}
  but the business cycle shock did \textbf{not} relate to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item inflation or TFP.
  \end{itemize}

  The authors suggest a confidence shock could lead to this result.

  We show shocks to financial conditions could also lead to this result.

\begin{frame}{Preview of Results}

  Using volatility financial conditions index (VFCI) to measure financial conditions, we find...

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Targeting VFCI generates same business cycle shock
    \item Including VFCI links inflation to the business cycle
  \end{itemize}
