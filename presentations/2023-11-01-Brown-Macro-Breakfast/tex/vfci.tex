  VFCI can be interpreted as the \textbf{price of risk}.  Constructed using 
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Asset returns
    \item Forward consumption growth
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.1cm}

  Can target consumption growth at different forward horizons.

  \vspace{0.25cm}

  Will use VFCI constructed targeting a horizon of 10 quarters.  Why?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item performs well
    \item lies within the business cycle length
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{0.1cm}

  Results are robust to similar horizon targets.
